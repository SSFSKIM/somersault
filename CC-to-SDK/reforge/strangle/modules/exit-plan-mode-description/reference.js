// PARITY LAYER (§2.5 `reference`) — one of C11a's sixteen moat-tool
// description builders. The text this returns is what the engine sends as the
// tool's `description` in every graded request body, so a single changed
// character is a byte difference on the requests surface: transcription is the
// whole risk and the differential is the whole defence. Nothing here is
// reflowed or re-punctuated, and the \u2014 escapes are upstream's own (the
// bundle contains zero literal em-dash bytes).
//
// Rendered only in the plan-mode catalog — 51 of the 82 recorded cassettes — so its
// covering scenario is `perm-plan-mode` rather than `plain`.
//
// Its initializer interpolates one tool name, which makes it a TEMPLATE
// EXPRESSION rather than a plain literal, so the build cannot compare its value
// against upstream's bytes and the row carries a written `valueUngraded`
// adjudication naming what does: strangle/moat-parity.test.ts evaluates
// upstream's own declarator with upstream's own constant and requires byte
// identity with this module.

export function exitPlanModeDescription() {
  return `Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.

## How This Tool Works
- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message
- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote
- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve
- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it

## When to Use This Tool
IMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.

## Before Using This Tool
Ensure your plan is complete and unambiguous:
- If you have unresolved questions about requirements or approach, use ${ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} first (in earlier phases)
- Once your plan is finalized, use THIS tool to request approval

**Important:** Do NOT use ${ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} to ask "Is this plan okay?" or "Should I proceed?" - that's exactly what THIS tool does. ExitPlanMode inherently requests user approval of your plan.

## Examples

1. Initial task: "Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.
2. Initial task: "Help me implement yank mode for vim" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.
3. Initial task: "Add a new feature to handle user authentication" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use ${ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.
