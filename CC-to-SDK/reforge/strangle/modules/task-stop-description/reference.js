// PARITY LAYER (§2.5 `reference`) — one of C11a's sixteen moat-tool
// description builders. The text this returns is what the engine sends as the
// tool's `description` in every graded request body, so a single changed
// character is a byte difference on the requests surface: transcription is the
// whole risk and the differential is the whole defence. Nothing here is
// reflowed or re-punctuated, and the \u2014 escapes are upstream's own (the
// bundle contains zero literal em-dash bytes).
//
// Upstream keeps it in the task-name constants chunk rather than beside the tool
// object that returns it, which is why the row is anchored on the prose and not
// on anything about the packaging. A no-substitution template literal, so its
// value is compared against upstream's bytes every build.
