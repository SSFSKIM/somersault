// PARITY LAYER (§2.5 `reference`) — one of C11a's sixteen moat-tool
// description builders. The text this returns is what the engine sends as the
// tool's `description` in every graded request body, so a single changed
// character is a byte difference on the requests surface: transcription is the
// whole risk and the differential is the whole defence. Nothing here is
// reflowed or re-punctuated, and the \u2014 escapes are upstream's own (the
// bundle contains zero literal em-dash bytes).
//
// A plain string constant, which is the shape the `variable-declarator` target
// exists for: the build compares this module's value against the pinned chunk's
// own bytes on every build, and that comparison is the only thing in the
// mechanism that can see a description whose WORDING moves while its minified
// name stays put — no anchor, no target hash and no capture hash move with it.
