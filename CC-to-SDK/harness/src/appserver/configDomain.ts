// with a `disabledReason` and no `raw`) is a DIFFERENT state, and collapsing the two destroys it at the
// one point it exists: a write-only settings file (mode 0200 is legal — write permission is independent
// of read permission) would read as "absent", and a CAS built on this same token would then take
// `expectedVersion: "absent"` as "create it" and overwrite bytes nobody ever read. The hash half is
// configWrite.ts's `versionToken` — a pure bytes→token function with TWO cases. The third token is not a
// property of any bytes but of a LAYER, so it is minted here, where layer state is what we hold.
